      <p class="head">Dear Hiring Manager,</p>

      <p>
        I am writing to express my interest in the Quality Analyst position at
        your esteemed organization. With about 4 years of experience in testing,
        issue resolution, and process improvement, I am confident in my ability
        to contribute to your team's success.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout my career, I have demonstrated a collaborative approach to
        problem-solving, ensuring product quality and maximizing customer
        satisfaction. I am a quiet person who values personal space but also
        understands the importance of teamwork. I believe in maintaining open
        and respectful communication with colleagues.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my current role as a Quality Analyst at Interpublic Group, I have
        been actively involved in auditing AEM projects, providing valuable
        feedback to developers and the team. I am responsible for maintaining
        quality standards throughout the project lifecycle and driving
        continuous process improvement. Additionally, I create checklists and
        documentation to streamline processes and ensure consistent
        deliverables. My participation in daily scrum calls enables effective
        communication and collaboration.
      </p>

      <p>
        Previously, I worked as a Software Tester at Quosphere, where I gained
        experience in functional and end-to-end testing. I actively contributed
        to an AI-driven project, ensuring quality across customer apps and a
        custom-built CRM tool. I collaborated with various stakeholders and
        developed automated scripts to enhance efficiency.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also have experience as a Game Tester at The KhelGroup, where I tested
        poker and betting games for online gamblers. I conducted various types
        of testing, including functional testing, payment gateway, and
        third-party service integration. My training in automation testing and
        analytics further enhanced my skills.
      </p>

      <p>
        I hold a BSc in Information Technology from the University of Mumbai and
        possess a range of technical skills, including auditing, manual testing,
        scripting (Selenium & Python), and responsive testing. I am proficient
        in HTML, CSS, JS, and have hands-on experience with tools such as
        Postman for API testing and SQL for database management.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond my professional pursuits, I enjoy exploring the internet, playing
        video games, and participating in sports such as cricket and carrom. I
        am also passionate about music and traveling, which provide me with a
        well-rounded perspective.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently, I am expanding my knowledge in Microsoft PowerBI to stay
        updated with the latest industry trends and advancements.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am excited about the opportunity to contribute my skills and
        experience to your team. Thank you for considering my application. I
        look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can add value to
        your organization.
